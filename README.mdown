These are Vim configs and scripts compiled by Brian Gershon (@brianfive) from various sources.

Inspired at PyCon 2010 by Python colleagues using Vim as their primary editor.

History
-------
* All initial configs forked from [@claytron](http://www.twitter.com/claytron)'s public repository of dotfile goodness [http://github.com/claytron/dotfiles](http://github.com/claytron/dotfiles) *See his repository's README for more details. At this point I'm just using Vim configs.*

More handy configs and recommendations that I'll be incorporating in are from:

* [@AaronVanderlip](http://www.twitter.com/AaronVanderlip)

* [@__gotcha](http://www.twitter.com/__gotcha) [https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/vimplone/branches/plippers-vim](https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/vimplone/branches/plippers-vim)

How I'm Using
-------------

*Note: I'm just using the Vim configs for now...*

1. Clone repository
  * `$ git clone git@github.com:briangershon/dotfiles.git`

2. Create symlinks as desired.  I'm currently just using Vim related settings.
  * `$ cd ~`
  * `$ ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vimrc`
  * `$ ln -s ~/dotfiles/.vim`
